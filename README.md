# miko-project
miko is a dnd disocrd bot to be an npc and also make collecting stats
npc he uses open ai API to join in any situation and a few random texts to his command to make him more alive

playing on discord for dnd sometime you want to collect funny data like deaths and how lucky one player has been 
with this editing the data wont be one persons tasks when it happens
making it more likely that said data is upto date

furture plans 
make a text to speach so the mute character can talk by their phone (our setting)
other things i get suggested down the pipeline

physical as my miko is run by a raspberry pi making him an asstant to my daliy life is the next step

miko will check my room for uninvited guest
heck on my metal state by monitorying when i quickly change from a productive to frozen state 
(idk when the last bit would be important for anyone else but me)
able to store tasks that a person needs to do to be desent (eat, wash clothes etc) to lower chance of my deprestion episodes
done by:
give me a random task if asked
telling user "man you need to eat"

also give an estimated time it would take to do by give data 
or if a new task taht is never done a give estimate by user of what they thinkl it will take

an alarm system to wake up to and by voice say if you NEED to wake up at certain times (bad sleeper sometimes)
